          4.1 The Data Principal will determine the scope, purposes, and manner
          by which the Personal Data may be accessed or processed by the Data

          <br />
          4.3 The Data Processor shall not process the Personal Data in a manner

          responsible for communicating the fact of such revocation to the Data
          Processor, and Data Processor shall remain responsible for
          implementing any Data Principal instruction with respect to the

          demonstrate the measures it has taken and shall allow the Data
          Principal to audit and test such measures. The Data Principal shall be
          entitled on giving at least 14 days’ notice to the Data Processor to
          carry out or have carried out by a third party who has entered into a
          confidentiality agreement with the Data Processor, audits of the Data
          Processor’s premises and operations as these relate to the Personal
          Data. The Data Processor shall cooperate with such audits carried out
          by or on behalf of the Data Principal and shall grant the Data
          Principal’s auditors reasonable access to any premises and devices
          involved with the Processing of the Personal Data. The Data Processor
          shall provide the Data Principal and/or the Data Principal’s auditors
          with access to any information relating to the Processing of the
          Personal Data as may be reasonably required by the Data Principal to

          account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the
          nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing. These measures
