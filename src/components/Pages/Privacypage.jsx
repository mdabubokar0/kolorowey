          to other Users. If you remove information that you have made public on
          the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages
          of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that

          require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or
          control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to

          Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally
          identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit
          pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with
          interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns
          for certain Kolorowey Media services and those of our partners. Our
          partners also have the option to publish the Test results for their
          websites on the Service. Such results consist solely of non-personally
          identifiable information. If you choose to publish such results on our
          Service (for example, in our Results Page), you understand and agree
          that this information, along with any personally identifiable
          information you choose to make available in connection with such
          results, will be made publicly available. By publishing your results
          on the Kolorowey Media Service, you agree that you have obtained all
          necessary consents to make such information public and that doing so
          will not violate any laws. If you remove information that you have
          made public on the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and
          archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved
          that information. Non-personally identifiable information may be
          stored indefinitely.

          KoloroweyMedia will disclose your information where required to do so
          by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is
          necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of
          law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the
          security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or

            How We Protect Your Information:

          <br />
          <br />
          Kolorowey Media is concerned with protecting your privacy and data,
          but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
          transmit to Kolorowey Media or guarantee that your information on the

          breach of any of our industry-standard physical, technical, or
          managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as a
          credit card number or log in credentials) on our registration or order
          forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer
          technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or
          method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we
          cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions
          about security on our Website, you can contact us at
          info@kolorowey.co.
          <br />
          <br />
          We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company
          to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain,
          share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other
          purposes.
